### 1. OTAFU 
</p>
<p>A video showing the OTA process using the vistual machine hosted on microsoft azure is shown below. </p>

Too large for github. Hence uploaded it to google drive.

### 2. GPIO Firmware Timing 
</p>
<p> A video showing the functioning of GPIO firmware timimg is shown below.</p>

<p> The average length of time is took to complete the function is 1.36104 ms.</p>

### 3. Node-Red Implementation 
</p>
<p>A video showing Node-Red setup is shown below.</p>

<p>Our Node-red implementation exploits the fact that the MCU is not required to check the working of the MQTT Broker. We have used the virtual machine to publish data to the respective topics and then subscrived to those topics using the node red server. We have $ topics that we publish or subscribe data from, these topics and their brief decription is listed below</p>

<p>1. Air_Velocity_Data: This gets an integer value which is published by the air velocity sensor in our board. However, we have made a simulator group in node-red which comproses of buttons for each MQTT Topic. The button press would publish an integer data to the topic. </p>

<p>2. IMU_Data: This topic is published with three different messages i.e.., the acceleration in three different axis x, y and z. A single button in the simulatoor window is used to publish three messages to the IMU_Data topic.</p>

<p>3. Environmental: This topic follows a similiar architecture as IMU_Data as it also has three messages being published  which are temperature, humidity and pressure which will all be measured by the BME680 Environmental sensor by Bosch. A single button press would publish these three messages to the Environmental Topic.</p>

<p>4. Automate: This topic will recieve or send a single boolean value depending upon the button press at the UI side. This value will instruct the Wind Turbine to  perform an automated positioning algorithm positioning itself in the most efficient direction for energy harvesting.</p>
</p> A debug capture is also shown below: </p>
